===============================================================================

### Dependancies
  - n/a

### Installation
  - Typical install method, though without the ./configure step:
        make
        make install PREFIX=/usr/local
  - You may be interested in looking at the Makefiles. They are quite simple!

### Post-Installation
  - You should have headers installed to ${PREFIX}/include/libcassava.
    Have a look at them if you want to use the functions in them.
