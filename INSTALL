LIBCASSAVA INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS                               06.08.2012
===============================================================================

### Dependancies
  - The function `print_columns` declared in `util.h` requires the function
    `ceil`, typically defined in the math library `m`.

### Compilation and Installation
  - The library is compiled and installed using the typical procedure:
        ./configure
        make
        make install

### Post-Installation
  - You should have headers installed to ${PREFIX}/include/cassava.
    Have a look at them if you want to use the functions in them.
